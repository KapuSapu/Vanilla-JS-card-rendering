# Hello,
**If product cards didn't reder correctly(at all) you are probably facing this error in console:
```
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://www.alza.cz/Services/RestService.svc/v2/products. (Reason: CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Origin’ does not match ‘http://www.alza.cz’).
Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://www.alza.cz/Services/RestService.svc/v2/products. (Reason: CORS request did not succeed).
```
I also faced it, so I recomend you to fix CORS policy.
In Mozilla Firefox you can simply install Cors Everywhere extension(```https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cors-everywhere/```) and turn it on.
Hope this advice will help.
Thank you for going through this test task. Feel free to critique  this code.
